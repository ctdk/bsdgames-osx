 * A 'combo' is a group of intersecting or overlapping frames and consists of
 * two numbers:
 * 'F' is the number of moves still needed to make the combo non-blockable.
 * 'W' is the minimum number of moves needed to win once it can't be blocked.
 *
 * A 'force' is a combo that is one move away from being non-blockable.
 *
 * Each time a frame is added to the combo, the number of moves to complete
 * the force is the number of moves needed to 'fill' the frame plus one at
 * the intersection point. The number of moves to win is the number of moves
 * to complete the best frame minus the last move to complete the force.
 * Note that it doesn't make sense to combine a <1,x> with anything since
 * it is already a force. Also, the frames have to be independent so a
 * single move doesn't affect more than one frame making up the combo.
 *
 * Rules for comparing which of two combos (<F1,W1> <F2,W2>) is better:
 * Both the same color:
 *	<F',W'> = (F1 < F2 || F1 == F2 && W1 <= W2) ? <F1,W1> : <F2,W2>
 *	We want to complete the force first, then the combo with the
 *	fewest moves to win.
 * Different colors, <F1,W1> is the combo for the player with the next move:
 *	<F',W'> = F2 <= 1 && (F1 > 1 || F2 + W2 < F1 + W1) ? <F2,W2> : <F1,W1>
 *	We want to block only if we have to (i.e., if they are one move away
 *	from completing a force, and we don't have a force that we can
 *	complete which takes fewer or the same number of moves to win).
